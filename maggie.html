          <p><b>Overview</b></p>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This assignment offers you an opportunity to more closely examine five
                    educational philosophies from your textbook and then apply them to a video case study. Keep in mind:
                    teaching is usually a blend of one or more of these philosophies, and it is important as a future
                    teacher
                    to be able to recognize some of the characteristics of the philosophies in practice and how they
                    impact
                    classrooms, teaching and learning.</span></p>
          <p><b>Step-by-Step Directions:</b></p>
          <ul>
               <li>
                    First, read over the following five philosophies of education in your textbook, and take notes about
                    their principles and how they might be enacted in a classroom:
                    Teacher-Centered Philosophies
               </li>
               <p style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Teacher-Centered Philosophies</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Essentialism</li>
                    <li>Perennialism</li>
               </ul>
               <p style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Student-Centered Philosophies</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Progressivism</li>
                    <li>Social Reconstructionism</li>
                    <li>and Existentialism</li>
               </ul>
               <li>Next, watch Video Segment #22: Essentialism in Action: A Classroom Lesson. As you are viewing the
                    video,
                    look for 5 moments that show evidence of one of the five philosophies. You can document evidence
                    from
                    only one or all of the philosophies. *You may need to watch the video several times to find your
                    evidence. </li>
               <li>As you choose your 5 moments, make sure to note the time that they occur in the video. Then, add each
                    moment, and the time it occurs, to the graphic organizer included with this assignment.</li>
               <li>Be sure to share a detailed and specific rationale for each of your choices. *Your rationales must be
                    substantive, providing sufficient evidence to explain why and how these moments relate to a specific
                    teaching philosophy.</li>
          </ul>
